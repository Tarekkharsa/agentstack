//! The versioned envelope every UI-facing JSON read carries (UI control-plane
//! §"Versioned contracts"). External panels (t3code) decode `schema_version`
//! first: an unknown major means "disable and show the upgrade path", never
//! "guess". `features` names usable end-to-end contracts — a feature appears
//! only when its full read/action loop works in this binary, so a UI can gate
//! each affordance on the named contract instead of sniffing individual
//! fields.
//!
//! This is presentation-layer negotiation only. No enforcement decision may
//! read these fields: the CLI re-validates every precondition on every call
//! whether or not the caller negotiated.

/// Bumped only when an existing field changes meaning or shape. Adding fields
/// or features is backward-compatible and does NOT bump this.

/// - `init-plan`: `init --plan` emits the detection plan with `plan_digest`.
/// - `apply-setup`: `init --yes --consented-plan <digest>` applies a reviewed
///   plan and refuses when the detected inputs drifted since the plan.
/// - `trust-preview`: `trust --preview` emits the full reviewed surface with
///   `surface_digest`.
/// - `trust-consent`: `trust --yes --consented-digest <digest>` grants bound
///   to the previewed bytes and refuses stale or missing digests.
/// - `status-v1`: `doctor --json` carries `state` + `next_action`.
/// - `profiles-v1`: `use --list --json` lists profiles with readiness.
/// - `diff-v1`: `diff --json` reports drift per target.
/// - `restore-last`: `restore --json` lists undoable writes; `restore --last
///   [--write]` previews/undoes the newest.
/// - `sessions-v1`: `use --list --json` carries per-profile `active` and the
///   top-level `session` object; `session start <profile>` activates
///   fail-closed (refuses untrusted or unpinned surfaces) and `session end`
///   reverts — including a session an interrupted UI left behind.
/// - `profiles-edit-v1`: `library-index` emits the central-library catalog
///   (skills + servers) for the browser; `add-skill-to-profile`,
///   `add-server-to-profile`, `create-profile`, and `use-profile` mutate the
///   toolset then re-lock + re-render, each bound to a `consent_digest` a prior
///   `--preview` returned (apply refuses on drift) and failing closed on an
///   unresolved `${REF}`.
/// - `workflow-observe-v1`: `workflow list --json` surfaces every declared
///   `[workflows.*]` entry with its per-entry trust + lock state (project-scoped
///   reads), and `workflow runs --json` lists recorded run history. Unlike the
///   other reads, `runs` reads the machine-global runs directory
///   (`agentstack_home()/runs`), not the project — run evidence is not
///   project-scoped. Both are read-only observation; running/resuming re-gates
///   independently.

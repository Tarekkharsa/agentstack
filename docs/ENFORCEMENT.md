# AgentStack — Enforcement matrix

This is the authoritative, code-grounded answer to one question: **for each
execution mode, what does AgentStack actually enforce, and by what mechanism?**
When any other document and this one disagree, this one is right — it is checked
against the source, not against intent.

## Claim discipline

AgentStack **restricts destinations and records decisions; it cannot guarantee
that sensitive content never leaves through an allowed destination.** An enforced
egress allowlist blocks connections to hosts you did not approve — it does not
inspect payloads, and it permits traffic to every host you *did* approve,
including the model API itself. A prompt-injected agent can still exfiltrate
through any allowed channel. The honest claim is: *untrusted project
declarations are not auto-activated, and unapproved egress is blocked on the
enforced paths* — never "exfiltration is impossible."

Read every cell below with that ceiling in mind. "Enforced" means the disallowed
action is *prevented at runtime* (by the kernel, the container boundary, or the
proxy); it never means the allowed action is *safe*.

## What "trusted" does and does not mean

Trusting a project asserts exactly one thing: **the current manifest, local
overlay, and lockfile consent digest was approved for automatic loading on this
machine.** The lockfile separately pins resolved server definitions, skills,
and instructions; drift in those inputs fails verification. Detached
signatures attest to lockfile bytes but do not silently create local trust.

Trusted does **not** mean:

- **Safe to run unsandboxed.** Trust gates *whether* a bundle's servers spawn,
  its skills enter context, and its secrets resolve. It does not confine what a
  running agent then does — that is the job of policy and the sandbox, per the
  matrix below.
- **Vetted for correctness or intent.** `agentstack trust` summarizes the
  runtime surface—commands, HTTP contacts, secret refs, and skill pin status—so
  *you* can judge it. AgentStack verifies the consent digest and lock pins; it
  does not vouch for what the referenced code does.
- **Tamper-proof against a compromised host agent.** In host mode the agent CLI
  runs as you, so it can in principle reach the user-writable trust store under
  `~/.agentstack/` and self-trust a bundle. Only the sandbox removes this. (A
  recorder-backed tamper log for trust-store mutations is *intended* but not yet
  wired — see the audit/recording row.)

Conversely, **untrusted project declarations are inert on automatic and
experimental execution paths**: the auto-project gateway does not spawn or
contact their MCP servers or resolve their secrets, and `tools_execute` refuses
to begin. This does not sandbox arbitrary repository code, prevent a user from
running it manually, or block an explicit static `agentstack apply`; those are
separate authorization and execution paths.

## The matrix

Modes are columns; policy dimensions are rows. Legend:

- **enforced** — a runtime mechanism prevents the disallowed action; bypass means
  defeating the kernel, the container, or the proxy.
- **coarse** — a real check runs, but at coarser granularity than the policy can
  express (whole-workspace mount vs. per-path; host-only at write time vs. exact
  host:port at runtime; once-at-construction vs. per-call).
- **unsupported** — no code path on this mode consults the policy for this
  dimension; the dimension has **no effect** here. (Stated bluntly rather than
  softened to "advisory": for these cells no check happens at all, so there is
  nothing to bypass.)
- **cooperative** — a real per-call check runs, but only because the harness
  chooses to consult it (a pre-tool-use hook). Protects against an agent's
  *accidents*; a harness that ignores its own hook protocol, or a process the
  harness never routes through hooks, bypasses it entirely. Strictly weaker
  than **enforced** and never to be described as enforcement.

| Dimension | `host` | `gateway` | `--sandbox` | `--lockdown` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Tools** | unsupported | **enforced** | **enforced**† | **enforced**† |
| **Egress** | coarse | coarse | **enforced**\* | **enforced** |
| **Secrets** | **enforced** | **enforced** | **enforced**‡ | **enforced**‡ |
| **Filesystem — write** | cooperative¶ | cooperative¶ | coarse | coarse |
| **Filesystem — read** | cooperative¶ | cooperative¶ | coarse | coarse |
| **Audit / recording** | unsupported | **enforced** | **enforced**§ | **enforced**§ |

\* **for proxied traffic only.** Plain `--sandbox` points `HTTPS_PROXY` at the
proxy but the container keeps an ordinary bridge network — a process that
ignores the proxy env can still dial out directly. The run is labelled
`SANDBOX / PROXIED · DIRECT ROUTE OPEN` for exactly this reason; only
`--lockdown` (no direct route, topological confinement) earns `ENFORCED`.
See the egress section below.

† **for MCP traffic routed through the gateway.** `run --sandbox[/--lockdown]`
of a *trusted* bundle now renders one gateway HTTP entry into the harness's
config (host-side gateway; the sidecar relay bridges it under lockdown) and
shadows any direct project config, so tool calls hit `Gateway::try_call` and
`[policy.tools]` is enforced there. The ceiling matches egress's: an agent that
reaches an upstream host *directly* — any host on `--sandbox`'s open route, or
an egress-*allowed* host under `--lockdown` — bypasses the gateway. Denying the
container direct egress to upstream hosts (leaving the relay the only path to
them) is the remaining step for an unconditional cell; until then this is
"enforced for what transits the gateway," not "impossible to evade." A run is
*not* routed at all — cell degrades to `unsupported` — in three cases, each
surfaced on stderr at run time: an *untrusted* bundle (empty gateway — no tool
policy, but also no secrets and no server spawn), a bundle with no proxied
servers, or a harness whose adapter *can't host an HTTP MCP entry* (stdio-only
config). The same three non-routed cases apply to the ‡ (secrets) and §
(audit) cells below.

‡ **for gateway-routed runs.** The host-side gateway resolves `${REF}` secrets
in its own memory and hands the container only the endpoint URL + a per-run
bearer token — resolved secret *values* never enter the container. A prior
`agentstack apply` that baked secrets into a project config is shadowed out.
(A run that isn't gateway-routed falls back to the coarse rendered-config path.)

§ **tool calls + secret refs now recorded.** A gateway-routed run's own
`events.jsonl` gains a `ToolCall` per call (digest-only args) and a
`SecretAccess` per resolved ref (name only), alongside the lifecycle + egress
events it already held. Trust-store mutations and cost/tokens remain unrecorded.
See the Audit / recording section.

Two of the four columns are execution modes for a *rendered* config: **host** is
`agentstack apply` + `agentstack run` (adapters write native config, the harness
runs on the bare machine and talks to upstream MCP servers directly).
**gateway** is the in-process broker (`agentstack mcp`, `connect`, code mode) —
every MCP call routes through `Gateway::try_call`. **--sandbox** and
**--lockdown** are `agentstack run --sandbox [--lockdown]`: the harness runs in a
Docker container behind the egress proxy.

## Per-cell notes

### Tools

- **host — unsupported.** `render_server()` and `plan_target_with_servers()`
  write the manifest's servers straight into the harness's native MCP config with
  the real command/URL; the harness then talks to upstream servers directly.
  `CompiledRuleset::tool_decision` is never called on this path.
  (`crates/adapters/src/render.rs`, `crates/cli/src/render/apply.rs`)
- **gateway — enforced.** Every call checks `tool_decision(server, tool)` before
  dispatch, and `namespaced_tools()` filters denied tools out of discovery too, so
  a denied tool is invisible *and* refused if called anyway. This is the single
  enforcement point. (`Gateway::try_call`, `crates/cli/src/gateway.rs`)
- **sandbox / lockdown — enforced for gateway-routed traffic.** A trusted run
  builds a host-side gateway (`Gateway::from_plan` — hard trust gate: untrusted
  → empty → unrouted) and a token-gated HTTP MCP endpoint, then renders one
  gateway entry into the harness's user-scope config and shadows any direct
  project config. The container's MCP calls therefore reach `Gateway::try_call`,
  where `[policy.tools]` is enforced exactly as in gateway mode (denied at
  discovery *and* at call), and each call is recorded in the run's own
  `events.jsonl`. Under `--sandbox` the container reaches the gateway directly
  (`host.docker.internal`); under `--lockdown` — no host route — it reaches the
  egress sidecar's fixed-destination **relay** (`crates/egress/src/relay.rs`),
  which splices to the host gateway. The relay is a dumb byte pipe: it parses
  nothing, runs no policy, and does no SSRF check (its destination is host-fixed,
  not client-chosen), so the real egress proxy's anti-SSRF guard is untouched;
  auth stays end-to-end at the gateway. The proxy still never parses MCP
  JSON-RPC — enforcement is at the gateway, not the proxy. **Ceiling:** an agent
  that opens its own connection to an upstream host the egress policy allows
  bypasses the gateway; making the relay the *only* route to upstream hosts
  (deny their direct egress) is the remaining step. (`Gateway::from_plan`,
  `crates/cli/src/gateway_http.rs`, `crates/cli/src/commands/sandbox.rs`
  `wire_sandbox_gateway`, `crates/runtime/src/lockdown.rs`)

### Egress

- **host — coarse.** Write/spawn-time check only: for HTTP servers the declared
  URL host is extracted and `egress_decision(name, host, None)` is called with
  **port `None`** when the config is written. A host hidden behind an unresolved
  `${REF}` fails closed only if the server is egress-constrained. There is no
  runtime traffic filtering once the harness is running natively.
  (`crates/cli/src/render/apply.rs`)
- **gateway — coarse.** For HTTP upstreams the resolved host is checked once at
  construction (`egress_decision(name, host, None)`, port `None`); a constrained
  server whose host can't be determined is skipped. There is no per-call egress
  re-check, and stdio (child-process) upstreams get no egress check at all — their
  network access is unconstrained by AgentStack. (`crates/cli/src/gateway.rs`)
- **sandbox — enforced.** Every CONNECT is checked against `EgressGuard::decide`
  with the **real port** from the CONNECT line; resolved addresses must be global
  unicast (anti-SSRF, `netguard`); the TLS ClientHello SNI must equal the CONNECT
  host (anti-domain-fronting); a per-run token gates who may use the proxy at all.
  **Topology caveat:** `--sandbox` gives the container an ordinary bridge network
  with `HTTPS_PROXY` pointed at a host proxy — a container that *ignored*
  `HTTPS_PROXY` could still reach the open internet directly. Egress is enforced
  for traffic that goes through the proxy, not guaranteed the way `--lockdown` is.
  (`crates/egress/src/proxy.rs`, `crates/cli/src/commands/sandbox.rs`)
- **lockdown — enforced (topological).** The container is attached ONLY to an
  internal Docker network whose sole reachable peer is the egress-proxy sidecar;
  there is no host route, no internet, no DNS beyond it. Ignoring the proxy env
  reaches *nothing*. The sidecar runs the identical `ServerProxy` enforcement as
  `--sandbox`. This is strictly stronger: confinement is topological, not
  convention. (`crates/runtime/src/lockdown.rs`, `crates/egress/src/proxy.rs`)

### Secrets

- **host — enforced, fail-closed.** `ScopedResolver::resolve` calls
  `secret_decision(server, name)` before returning any value; a denied or
  unresolvable `${REF}` blocks the write rather than emitting a literal
  placeholder. Once allowed, the concrete value is written into the native config
  file on disk — that on-disk exposure is a separate, accepted fact (ARCHITECTURE
  Layer 1), not a policy gap. (`crates/cli/src/secret/mod.rs`)
- **gateway — enforced, fail-closed.** A per-server `ScopedResolver` substitutes
  every `${REF}` through `secret_decision`; a ref outside `[policy.secrets]` fails
  to resolve, and the call is refused outright if any refs remain unresolved for
  that server. Same mechanism as host mode. (`crates/cli/src/gateway.rs`)
- **sandbox / lockdown — enforced, for a gateway-routed run.** A trusted run
  routes MCP through the host-side gateway (`Gateway::from_plan`), which resolves
  `${REF}`s fail-closed in its own memory via the same per-server `ScopedResolver`
  as gateway mode. Resolved secret *values* stay on the host — the container
  receives only the gateway's endpoint URL and a per-run bearer token. A prior
  `agentstack apply` that baked literal secrets into the project config is
  actively neutralized: `wire_sandbox_gateway` mounts an empty config over that
  path (shadowing it), so those bytes never reach the container either.
  **Fallback:** a run that is *not* gateway-routed — an untrusted bundle, a
  harness with no servers, or one that can't host an HTTP MCP entry — has no
  host-side resolution and, if a stale rendered config sits in the workspace, the
  container sees whatever was baked there. That path is coarse, as before.
  (`crates/cli/src/gateway.rs`, `crates/cli/src/commands/sandbox.rs`)

### Filesystem — write

- **host / gateway — cooperative (¶), when the guard is installed.** No
  sandbox, no mount, no kernel path-scoping touches either path — `runs.rs`
  spawns the harness against the real filesystem, and stdio MCP children run
  with the ambient user's full permissions. What DOES run is the host guard:
  `agentstack guard install` wires `agentstack guard check` into each
  detected CLI's own pre-tool-use hook (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, Cursor,
  Windsurf, Copilot CLI, Antigravity, OpenCode, Pi; VS Code agent mode reads
  the Claude-format user hooks). Per tool call it blocks: destructive
  commands (`rm -rf` outside the workspace, `git reset --hard`, `git clean
  -f`, disk writes, …), any access to `[policy.filesystem] deny` globs
  (machine ∪ project — a repo can only add), and file-tool writes outside
  the workspace + `[guard] allow_roots` + temp. Denials are recorded to the
  audit log (`host-guard` entries in `calls.jsonl`). The ceiling is the
  legend's: the harness must honor its own hook protocol — this catches
  accidents, not malice, and Claude Desktop / Junie expose no hook surface
  at all (their cells are effectively *unsupported*). Config unreadable →
  the hook fails CLOSED; unrecognized payload shapes fail open (a guard
  that wedges the harness gets uninstalled, not fixed).
  (`crates/cli/src/guard.rs`, `crates/cli/src/commands/guard.rs`)
- **sandbox / lockdown — coarse.** The whole workspace is one bind mount, mounted
  `:ro` unless the effective write scope covers the workspace root
  (deny-by-default — the one dimension where absence means deny). A partial scope
  like `src/**` rounds *down* to read-only, since it's one all-or-nothing mount.
  The kernel enforces the `:ro` bind, not the harness. Coarse by definition:
  whole-workspace, not per-path. (`crates/cli/src/commands/sandbox.rs`,
  `CompiledRuleset::workspace_write_decision` in `crates/policy/src/ruleset.rs`)

### Filesystem — read

- **host / gateway — cooperative (¶), deny globs only.** The same hook guard
  checks every file-tool read and shell token against `[policy.filesystem]
  deny` (`.env`, key files, …) — so `cat .env`, `Read(.env)`, and `cp .env
  /tmp` are blocked in everyday host use. Reads are otherwise NOT confined
  to the workspace (confine-all-reads would break the harness itself; that
  is what the sandbox's mount boundary is for), and `FsRules.read` scopes
  are still never consulted on these paths.
  (`crates/cli/src/guard.rs`, `crates/cli/src/commands/guard.rs`)
- **sandbox / lockdown — coarse.** The whole workspace is visible inside the
  container and nothing outside the mounted workspace directory is — so the
  workspace boundary itself is a real, kernel-level read scope. But no finer mount
  is created from `[policy.filesystem] read`, so read globs narrower than the whole
  workspace are informational only. (`crates/cli/src/commands/sandbox.rs`,
  `crates/runtime/src/spec.rs`)

### Audit / recording

- **host — unsupported.** Native host-mode runs never call `calllog::record`
  because the harness talks to upstream MCP servers directly, bypassing AgentStack
  entirely. Audit happens only if the harness is separately configured to route
  via the gateway (`agentstack mcp`). (`crates/cli/src/runs.rs`)
- **gateway — enforced.** `Gateway::try_call` logs every outcome (denied / ok /
  error) via `calllog::record` to `~/.agentstack/audit/calls.jsonl`. Only an
  argument *digest* is stored, never raw values or resolved secrets, and upstream
  error text is reduced to a fixed class so a malicious upstream can't write
  arbitrary bytes into the log. This is the most complete audit dimension.
  (`crates/cli/src/gateway.rs`, `crates/recorder/src/lib.rs`)
- **sandbox / lockdown — enforced (for a gateway-routed run).** `RunLog::create`
  is mandatory and fails closed ("nothing trusted runs unobserved"). The run log
  captures container lifecycle (`SandboxStarted` / `SandboxExited`) and every
  egress decision — and, now that a trusted run's MCP traffic routes through the
  host-side gateway, every **tool call** (`ToolCall`: server, tool, outcome,
  argument *digest* only — never values) and every **secret reference** resolved
  (`SecretAccess`: ref *name* only). The gateway mirrors these into the run's own
  `events.jsonl` because it inherits the run id (`Gateway::from_plan`), so
  `agentstack report <run>` reads a self-contained record without the
  cross-project audit log. Still missing from a run's log: trust-store mutations
  (below) and cost/tokens. A run that isn't gateway-routed (untrusted bundle, or
  no servers) records only lifecycle + egress. (`crates/cli/src/gateway.rs`
  `log_call`, `crates/cli/src/commands/sandbox.rs`)

### Not yet wired: trust-store mutation logging

ARCHITECTURE Layer 2 describes logging every trust-store mutation as tamper
evidence, as mitigation for the host-mode self-trust risk. **As of this writing
that is intended, not implemented** — the trust command and `crates/trust` call no
recorder. Treat it as a planned mitigation, not a shipped guarantee, until a
run/audit event for trust mutations exists.

## Experimental `tools_execute`

This is a separate, machine-opt-in mode with a narrower runtime surface than a
whole harness sandbox. It is available only in builds with the `sandbox`
feature and has no host fallback.

| Property | Status | Mechanism and honest limit |
|---|---|---|
| Project identity | **enforced** | Current project digest must be in the trust store before files, Docker, relay, or upstream dispatch. Trust covers AgentStack manifest layers/lockfile, not every arbitrary repository file. |
| Enablement | **enforced** | Only `[experimental] tools_execute = true` in the machine manifest is consulted. The same table in a repo cannot enable it. |
| Tool authority | **enforced** | Immutable, exact namespaced grant; per-run authenticated relay checks membership and count; the existing gateway re-applies compiled machine ∩ project tool policy. Allowed tools can still have side effects. |
| Secrets | **enforced** | No resolved secret, gateway environment, or relay credential appears in guest env/result/events. Upstream processes still receive secrets that their declared server configuration authorizes. |
| Filesystem read | **enforced** | Guest sees only a private read-only `/app` mount containing source, JSON input, bootstrap, generated bindings, and relay token. The policy ruleset is mounted only into the sidecar. The guest does not receive workspace, AgentStack home, Docker socket, or host home mounts. Container/kernel escape is outside this claim. |
| Filesystem write | **enforced** | Read-only root and `/app`; only a 16 MiB `noexec,nosuid,nodev` `/tmp` tmpfs and one pre-created, 1 MiB-capped result-file bind are writable. |
| Direct egress | **enforced** | Internal Docker network has only the egress sidecar as peer. Its ordinary proxy requires an undisclosed separate token; the fixed raw relay reaches only the host execution relay. The host relay binds the narrowest interface the sidecar can still reach via `host.docker.internal`: the private, non-routable docker0 bridge gateway on a native Linux daemon, or the host loopback on Docker Desktop — never a LAN-facing interface. It stays reachable from Docker containers on the host (not from other LAN hosts); the residual `0.0.0.0` wildcard bind applies only as a fallback when a Linux host cannot bind that gateway (Docker-Desktop-on-Linux, whose gateway lives in the VM). Its random token, exact grant, bounded protocol, and execution-scoped lifetime are the control. No payload/content inspection occurs on allowed tool results. |
| Process isolation | **enforced** | Non-root uid/gid 65532, capabilities dropped, `no-new-privileges`, 128 MiB memory, one CPU, 32 PIDs. Docker's configured/default seccomp policy, Docker itself, and the host kernel remain trusted computing base; AgentStack does not yet ship a custom executor seccomp profile. |
| Limits | **enforced** | Machine-owned timeout, output, and call defaults are configurable only below compiled hard ceilings; requests may only narrow them. Aggregate stdout/stderr and separate result/source/input bytes, granted-tool count, and relay call count are bounded. A tool call already dispatched upstream cannot be revoked atomically. |
| Recording | **enforced** | Run log creation is required. Events store digests and metadata, never source/input/result/secret values; tool calls carry execution IDs and render beneath the execution in `agentstack report`. Recording is evidence, not tamper-proof remote attestation. |
| Runtime supply chain | **partial** | Node image is pinned by repository digest. AgentStack does not yet publish an executor-specific SBOM, attestation, or independent scan, so the feature remains experimental. |
